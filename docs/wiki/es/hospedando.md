# 🎯 • Tutorial

> There are thousands of online hosting services for Discord bots, and many of them are completely free. Once you have chosen a service, you can follow the steps provided by your hosting service. Usually, you will have a control panel called "Pterodactyl." Simply add the folder of the bot that you have extracted and configured in that panel, restart the bot from the console, and you're all set! From now on, you will be able to manage the bot using commands in Discord. **Note**: This is a general tutorial but does not guarantee to be 100% applicable in all cases. Please refer to the documentation of your hosting service for specific instructions.
