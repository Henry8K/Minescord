# ✅ • Getting Started

> To ensure a seamless experience for our users we have created a small website with a little information for new users who are new to Discord or are new to the subject of downloading, creating and hosting Discord bots. Also if you need additional help you can create an issue and ask for more information. However, if you already know the process, please download the bot via realeases.
